## Results from Paquereau et al. 2025 - Galaxy clustering from z = 0.1 to z = 12 in COSMOS-Web

- Clustering measurements: angular auto-correlation function as a function of angular scales with uncertainties, and galaxy number densities. Each set of files (theta, wtheta, wsig, ndgal) corresponds to a different redshift bin.
- SHMR, defined in two ways: Mstar_median/Mh_min or Mstar_threshold/Mh_min. Each file corresponds to a different redshift bin.
- HOD model (Zheng+05 model) parameters and model-derived quantities (satellite fraction and galaxy bias). Each table corresponds to a different redshift bin and stellar mass threshold.
- Satellite fraction and galaxy bias, as a function of redshift. Each file corresponds to a different stellar mass limited bin.
